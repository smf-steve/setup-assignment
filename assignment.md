## Overview
The goal of this assignment is:
  1. to provide you with a little bit of exposure to a markdown language,
  1. to ensure you understand the mechanics of submitting document assignments,

### Directions:

Provide a response to all items that have been marked as needing a response. 
  1. An HTML comment tag `(<!-- response -->)` have been added to each line that requires a response.
  1. your response should be placed to the left of this HTML comment tag.

In each of your responses note that spacing is very important to ensure your document is rendered correctly on the web. You should review the final formatted document via, e.g., One Markdown, prior to final submission.

In this assignment, fake answers have been provided. You must replace the provided answers with your own answers.

For more information about the markdown (MD) format see:

#### Section One
1. Enumerate your top four favorite subjects in college:
   1. Intro to sarcasm                                                        <!-- response -->
   1. Advance microsurgery                                                    <!-- response -->
   1. Procrastination Studies                                                 <!-- response -->
   <!-- 
        A '1. ' introduces an ordered list.  
        To add the fourth subject, simple add a line to the list starting with '1. '. 
        The Markdown viewer will automatically assigned the appropriate line number. 
        Also note that positioning of all the '1. 's above; they all must begin
        in the same column number. 
   -->
 

1. What is your major?
   > Basket weaving                                                           <!-- response -->
   <!-- 
        Place your response after the first '> '.  
        A '> ' introduces a block quote.  
        Also note that the '> ' is positioned directly under the first character
        after the '1. ' above.  This is important!
   -->


1. Provide a list of possible positions you would like to obtain after graduation.
   * Bottle washer                                                            <!-- response -->
   * Prone                                                                    <!-- response -->
   * Phrenologist                                                             <!-- response -->
   * Soda Jerk                                                                <!-- response -->
   * Knocker-up                                                               <!-- response -->
  <!-- 
       This is an example of an unordered list.  
       An unordered list can begin with either '* ' or '- '.  
       Feel free to add and delete response lines as needed.
  -->

#### Section Two
1. What is your primary reason for taking COMP122?
   > I'm forced to take it, because it is required!                           <!-- response -->

1. What is the most important thing you want to get out of COMP122?
   > An enjoyable time during class; make me laugh!                           <!-- response -->

1. What is your criteria for success for COMP122?
   > I will consider this class to be a success if and only if I              <!-- response -->
     am able to improve my Java coding skills. I want to be an                <!-- response -->
     Application Developer and there is no need for me to waste               <!-- response -->
     my time to learn anything else. I want to be a one-trick pony.           <!-- response -->
                                                                              <!-- response -->
   <!-- The above is an example of a multi-line response. -->
   <!-- Feel free to add or remove additional response lines as needed. -->

1. What one thing can I do to help ensure you are successful in this class?
   * Pizza, and plenty of it!                                                 <!-- response -->

#### Section Three
1. Modify the following Java method, `add4`, to include a fourth 
   formal parameter.

   ```java
   static int add4(int a, int b, int c) {                                     
     int sum=0;

     sum = a + b + c;

     return sum;
   }
   ```
   <!-- 
        The three ticks ('`') open up a code block. You can also include
        the tag (e.g., java) that identifies how to render the code.
        All the code must be between the two sets of 3-ticks, and the code
        must also be lined up.
        For code blocks, I don't expect you to include any "response" tags.
   -->
